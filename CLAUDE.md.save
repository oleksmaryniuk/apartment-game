Project Goal: Create a simple 2D top-down "Apartment Exploration" mini-game in a single index.html file using Vanilla JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas.

Technical Requirements:

Rendering: Use a single <canvas> element. The background should be an image named apartment.png.

Player Movement: > - The player is represented as a small dot/circle.

Implementation of movement via Arrow Keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) with pixel-based increments.

Initial spawn point: Hallway (I will provide exact coordinates later).

Game Mechanics & State:

Items: Two items represented by emojis: 🔑 (Key) and 👀 (Eyes).

Interaction: Picking up an item occurs when the player's coordinates overlap with the item's position.

Conditional Obstacle: There is a horizontal "wall" (collision line) blocking the entrance to the kitchen. This wall must disappear ONLY after the 🔑 (Key) is collected.

UI/HUD:

In the top-right corner, implement a status indicator for both items.

Default state: Greyed out (low opacity).

Collected state: Fully visible/colored once picked up.

Code Structure:

Keep everything in one file for portability.

Use requestAnimationFrame for a smooth game loop.

Define a walls array for collision detection (placeholders for now).
